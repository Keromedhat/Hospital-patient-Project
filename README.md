# 🏥 Hospital Patient Analysis Project

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of hospital patient records using a combination of SQL and Python. It addresses key healthcare questions, including the most frequent diagnoses, busiest hospital departments, and patient discharge trends over time.

## 📌 Project Overview

The dataset is maintained in a table named `hospital_patient_records`, which includes the following fields:
- `Age`
- `Diagnosis`
- `Department`
- `Status` (e.g., admitted, discharged)
- `Doctor`
- `DischargeDate`

This project demonstrates effective use of SQL for data extraction alongside Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies

- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Programming Languages:** SQL, Python  
- **Python Libraries:**  
  - `pandas`  
  - `numpy`  
  - `matplotlib`  
- **Development Environments:**  
  - Jupyter Notebook (exploratory data analysis and visualization)  
  - PyCharm (Python development)

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing using Python to address missing values, standardize text fields, and correct data types.  
- Execute SQL queries to:  
  - Calculate the average age of patients for each diagnosis.  
  - Identify the department with the highest number of admitted patients.  
  - Analyze monthly patient discharge counts.  
  - Determine the most common diagnosis among patients.  
  - Find the doctor who treated the most patients.  
- Utilize Python’s data visualization tools to illustrate trends and support data-driven insights.
