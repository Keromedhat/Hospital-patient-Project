# 🏥 Hospital-patient-Project

This project is a simple yet insightful analysis of hospital patient records using SQL and python. It explores common healthcare-related questions such as the most frequent diagnoses, the busiest departments, and discharge trends over time.

## 📌 Overview

The dataset used in this project is stored in a table named `hospital_patient_records`, which contains fields such as:
- `Age`
- `Diagnosis`
- `Department`
- `Status` (e.g., admitted, discharged)
- `Doctor`
- `DischargeDate`
  
This project demonstrates how to use SQL for data querying and Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for further analysis and visualization.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Database:** MySQL
- **Languages:** SQL, Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
